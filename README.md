## What's RocketSys?
RocketSys is a simple object-orientated API for launching rockets in Roblox featuring real world physics equations. Don't worry if you're not a coder though - we've provided many examples and rocket presets in the repository. You can find tutorials and documentation on [our website](https://sublivion.github.io/RocketSys/). Sublivion - who founded the project at the beginning of 2019 - codes the API and other developers are working on presets and example scripts.

## Aims
- The original Rocket System aims: allow everyone to simulate realistic rocket and missile launches in Roblox games
- Provide a better and less limited experience than its predecessor: RocketSys II

## Community
